# Ectert Raytracer

Ectert is a software raytracer written in C++, 
modeled after the one described in Jamis Buck's The Raytracer Challenge.

The project uses CMake for building and GoogleTest for unit tests.

Ectert is still in very early stages of development, but will gain features quickly 
as I work through Buck's book.
